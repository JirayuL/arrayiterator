# arrayiterator by Jirayu Laungwilawan
* Many collections and data structures provide an Iterator so we can iterate over all the elements in the collection without knowing the structure of the collection.
* In Java, an Iterator is any object that implements the java.util.Iterator interface. This interface has a type parameter that describes the type of element the Iterator returns.
